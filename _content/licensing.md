Our objective is to continually release high-quality sanctions and persons of interest data as a resource for civil society and business. In order to make this sustainable over time, we've decided to use a dual licensing scheme, based on the terms of [Creative Commons 4.0 Attribution NonCommercial](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/).

We encourage companies to use OpenSanctions data in a commercial context. If you intend to do so, **please contact us at [info@opensanctions.org](/contact/)** to discuss the terms of obtaining a license.

### License exceptions (journalism, advocacy)

Beyond the definition of [non-commercial use](https://creativecommons.org/faq/#does-my-use-violate-the-noncommercial-clause-of-the-licenses) provided by Creative Commons, we also grant a zero-cost license to the groups listed below. They are entitled to use the data pursuant to the terms of [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), but not to undertake any commercial redistribution of the data in bulk or in large parts.

* Any person, group or organisation whose primary aim is the **production of public-interest reporting**, such as broadcast or newspaper media, or groups that meet the [GIJN membership criteria](https://gijn.org/membership-in-gijn/).

* Public interest groups working to to advance [human rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights) or the promotion of democratic governance. 

We further reserve the right to issue zero-cost licenses to other individuals and groups. Please [contact us](/contact/) if you'd like to use OpenSanctions but see the required licensing as a hindrance in doing so.
