title: About this project
summary:
    OpenSanctions is an international database of persons and companies of political, criminal, or economic interest. 
---

The project combines the most relevant sanctions lists, databases of politically exposed persons, and other information about persons in the public interest into a single, easy-to-use dataset. The data and the code used to make it are distributed for free.

This makes it easy to:

* **Cross-check databases** for conflicts of interests and signs of illicit activity.
* **Screen potential customers** and partners in international dealings.
* **Track political conflicts** and compare world-wide sanctions policies.
* Integrate due diligence data into existing data products.

### The rationale

Collecting persons of interest data is a labour intensive process: data users need to scrape data from  [dozens of sources](/datasets/), then parse partial and sometimes incorrect information about nationalities, birth dates and identifiers. De-duplicating common entries across many data sources poses another time-consuming challenge.

This creates unnecessary and duplicative work for all users of persons-of-interest data, whether they are fintech/regtech technologists, investigative journalists, academics or others.

We believe that the solution to this is to establish a **data commons**, an open resource  that provides high-quality, up-to-date data, is open to contributions and feedback and set up to [provide a long-term solution](/sponsor/) for data sourcing.

### Team

The development of OpenSanctions is coordinated by [Friedrich Lindenberg](https://pudo.org).
From 2017 to 2019, maintenance of the crawlers was assumed by [Tarashish Mishra](https://sunu.in/) at the [Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project](https://occrp.org). You can
see a list of those who have contributed crawlers [on Github](https://github.com/pudo/opensanctions/graphs/contributors).

We'd also like to thank [Marc da Costa](https://marcdacosta.com/), [Paul May](https://twitter.com/mrpaulmay) and [Tony Bowden](https://twitter.com/tmtm) for their tireless advice on the
project.
