title: Using the OpenSanctions API
summary: >
    Our API provides an easy way to integrate OpenSanctions data into your workflow. You can
    automatically search the database and conduct batch screening to identify people or
    companies that are included on a sanctions list or linked to politically exposed persons
    (PEPs).

The [OpenSanctions API](https://api.opensanctions.org/) is an open source search appliance built to let users search and cross-reference sanctions, criminals and PEPs data.

* [API documentation (OpenAPI)](https://api.opensanctions.org/)
* [Installation instructions](https://github.com/opensanctions/yente/blob/main/README.md) for the API service, based on `docker-compose`.
* Tutorial: [Using the matching API to do KYC-style checks](/articles/2022-02-01-matching-api/)
* Tutorial: [Using OpenRefine to match entities in a spreadsheet](/articles/2022-01-10-openrefine-reconciliation/)
* [License terms](/licensing/) for the data (CC 4.0 BY NC).

***Important notice:** If you want to use the API as part of an application your are building, you should either [operate the service locally](/docs/self-hosted/), or [contact us](/contact/) to discuss a service agreement.*

Running the API on your own premises will guarantee privacy and security, while ensuring your independence from OpenSanctions as a service provider.
