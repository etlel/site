### Get to know the data

Data licensing applies to the following collections by default: 

* [Sanctions-only data](/datasets/sanctions/) bulk downloads with data from 25+ sanctions lists.
* [Full OpenSanctions data](/datasets/default/) bulk downloads with all data sources.

As you start processing the data, we recommend you read the introduction to [entity data](/docs/entities/) and have a look at the [data dictionary](/reference/).

### Get to know the API

While our [API is documented](/docs/api/) publicly, we ask commercial users to add an authorization header that identifies them. Please add the following to all of your HTTP requests sent to `api.opensanctions.org`:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your@email.com>
```

This way, we know that traffic coming from you is legitimate and we will exempt you from rate limiting and IP blocking that we apply to anonymous traffic from time to time.

### Get to know us

OpenSanctions is meant to be a conversation. Whether it is about using the existing data formats, proposing a new data source or reporting a mistake in the data - we are keen to know your thoughts and concerns.

* Join the **[OpenSanctions Slack](https://bit.ly/osa-slack)** and post any questions and comments to the `#support` channel.
* Please also always feel free to contact us at **info@opensanctions.org**.
